# cicon

This is an Icon Pack based on Ameixa and used CandyBar as Dashboard.

It starts with the Issue of Trebuchet, that all legacy App Icons (like in Ameixa Icon Pack) displayed horrible in the Launcher. So I decided to make an own adaptive Icon Pack with my favourite Icons from Ameixa.

After trying a few Icon Pack Templates, i found the CandyBar Dashboard wich is perfect for my Case. It also have the Function to send the ID's of installed Apps that don't have an Icon already with an mail to me (only if you want).
